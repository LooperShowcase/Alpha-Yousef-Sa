      Once upon a time, there was an 11-year-old kid named Yousef who had a deep
      love for coding. He spent countless hours exploring programming languages
      and creating his own digital projects. Yousef's passion for coding led him
      to attend a prestigious coding camp, where he met like-minded individuals
      who shared his enthusiasm. Together, they embarked on coding adventures,
      solving challenges and building innovative projects. .
